A brief manual for tomoDD

(1) before compile tomoDD, make sure the following parameters are set up
    correctly. 
    In ray_common.inc:
    mxpari and maxpar (>=iuses*(nx-2)*(ny-2)*(nz-2))
    maxnx, maxny, and maxnz should be equal or larger than the corresponding
    values in the file MOD ( starting velocity model)

    In include/tomoDD.inc
    MAXEVE, MAXS and MAXDATA should be equal to or larger than the 
    corresponding real values.

    Note: all the above parameters affect the memory space greatly. So my 
    recommendation is to set up these parameters equal to or a little bit larger 
    than the actually values.

(2) Set up tomoDD.inp
    Most of the parameters in this file are the same as those in hypoDD.inp.
    The following list those different parameters:
 
   Output velocity file (unit 16): specify a name that you want. This file 
      will save the DWS values for P- and S-wave, and Velocity values at 
      different iterations.

   Absolute data file: Different from hypoDD, tomoDD also reads into the 
      absolute travel time data. Again you can specify a name that you want.
      This file has the following format:
    # eventID1
    station travel_time weight phase
    .......
    # eventID2
    ........

   MOD: this file contains information of the starting velocity model and the
        inversion grid set-up. YOU MUST SPECIFY EXACTLY THE SAME NAME. The 
        format of this file is as follows:
        bld, nx, ny, nz
        xd(1),xd(2), ...., xd(nx)
        yd(1),yd(2), ...., yd(ny)
        zd(1),zd(2), ...., zd(nz)
        Vp values (NZ*NY*NX)
        Vp/Vs values (NZ*NY*NX)

   CC_format: 1------- CC data has hypoDD format
              2------- CC data has the format as follows:
              
	       eveID1 eveID2 sta dt weight phase
  Note it assumes that waveform data have the same origin times as 
  catalog data.

  weight1, weight2, weight3:
    -------- first order smoothing constraint to slowness changes.

 iuses: 1---- Only invert P-wave velocity
        2---- Both P and S wave veloity

       
  lat_Orig, lon_Orig, Z_Orig: the coordinate center
  iorig: 0------- use the cluster center as the coordinate center
         1--------use the user specified coordinate center  
  rota: rotation of the coordinate system: anticlockwise (-), clockwise (+)

  For tomoDD, only lsqr is used due to the huge amount of data (isolv=2).

  For other parameters related to 3D ray tracing, you do not need to specify them unless 
  you are quite familiar with simul2000.

  WTCD: relative weighting between the absolute and differential catalog data
  THRES: the scalor used to determine the DWS threshold value (THRES*average DWS value). 
         The average DWS values for P and S are determined in the program. When DWS 
         (derivative weight sum) value at a node is smaller than it, the node will be 
         fixed during the inversion.
